/**
 * Name: Jake Billings
 * Date: 03/30/2018
 * Class: CSCI 2312
 * Description:
 *
 * Problem
 * =======
 * This assignment will have you read information in from various files, perform exception handling when reading those
 * files, and create a base class and derived classes with virtual functions to read the various files, perform some
 * computations on the inputs as described below, and print the file details.
 *
 * For this assignment, create a base class called Animal.  It should have as member variables any variables that are
 * contained across all animals in this assignment along with any associated mutator and accessor member functions.
 * You will create a derived class for each of the following: dog, fish, horse, monkey and lizard.  The member functions
 * to read and output the objectâ€™s information will be virtual functions.  Each derived class must contain the
 * additional member variables and member functions needed to include all fields in each input file. Each input file
 * will contain data about one object; you will not be required to read in information about multiple objects from
 * one file.
 *
 * My Solution
 * ===========
 * I implement virtual print() and read() functions. Then, I override the normal stream operators to use these virtual
 *  functions. If at any point, the stream fails to read a required value or an invalid value is presented,
 *  then the read() function throws an exception. The main() function catches this exception and displays
 *  an error.
 * I throw exceptions if function attempt to set weights/heights into the negatives on the Dog/Horse objects.
 *
 *
 * Test Strategy
 * =============
 *  See test()
 *
 *  I run unit tests that ensure that the stream operator (which uses the virtual read() function) properly reads data
 *   from the example data files.
 *  I also created garbage/corrupted/fuzzy test files and read those. I have unit tests that verify that exceptions
 *   are thrown when this occurs.
 *  I also have a demo that prints the results of the the mandatory calculations, and I check the results manually.
 *
 * Status: Runs on OSX using CLion and on csegrid using g++
